The full quote is\\n\\n\"\"If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,\\nthen that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly\\nfeasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in\\nthe near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher\\noperational temperatures.\"\"\\n\\nIt then goes on to say\\n\\n\"\"As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL\\ntethers needed.

Existing materials will do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"\"\\n\\nSo it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with \"\"presently available commercial materials.\"\"\\n\\nTo further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states\\n\\n\"\"The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is\\ntechnically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will\\nallow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space\\ntether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into\\nEarth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design\\nsolution using existing, or near-term technologies.

Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker. So, go eat some more food and drown your sorrows you premature ejaculating, bald headed fuck.\\n\\nYou should do something nice for yourself, maybe go grab a couple of Horny Goat Weeds from your local convenience store and jack off for a little longer than three minutes tonight.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nAn Asshole That's Better Than You In Every Way.\"\n",

We middle-eastern Christians, though not arabs, have gone through Arabization, and that needs to stop. We are not arabs. We have our own ethnicity, and we shouldn\\'t be forced to be called \"\"Christian arabs\"\". If a Christian European is born in the middle east, should he be called a \"\"Christian arab\"\" because of that reason alone? Please understand, they are Syriac Christians (i.e. of Assyrian ancestry), and most of them speak Aramaic, though a lot of them are forgetting it. As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they\\'re in the middle east.

      "b'\"\\n\\nIs it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don\\'t answer the questions beyond that\\nWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \\n\\nFirst, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \\n\\nSecond, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it\\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \\n\\nFinally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\\'s what killed him. You don\\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\\'ve never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\\'t science.  \"'\n",

      "b'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.\\n\\nThe major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.'\n",

age, character or knowledge. The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.\\n\\nThe Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           History\\nThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       Proper History\\nAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\"\n",

LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) \\nBy the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15\"\n",

Again, if you would like evidence just ask.\\n\\nIt would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under \"\"UK mediation\"\" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you. If you\\'re going to be an admin, may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message. Rather than accusing me, a user who is being cyberstalked, of \"\"personal attacks\"\".

      "b'\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  \\xc4\\x8ciurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. \\xc4\\x8ciurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ram\\xc5\\xabnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1930  painter and composer  \\xc4\\x8ciurlionis, painter Kazys \\xc5\\xa0imonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vyd\\xc5\\xabnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantait\\xc4\\x97 - \\xc4\\x8ciurlionien\\xc4\\x97, poets Adomas Jak\\xc5\\xa1tas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys \\xc5\\xa0imkus, philosopher Ram\\xc5\\xabnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

If anything at all, just a brief mention of the raising of TRAP and MOUTH in a pre-nasal environment would suffice.  I just thought it was an American thing to raise  before nasals (I do it myself), but I often hear Aussies do it quite a bit as well, and I don't hear English people do it at all.  The only difference is that Americans have a tendency to diphthongize it as well as raising it.  \\nI'm not really surprised you don't have a broad accent, being a Wikipedian.  I'm not saying it's not possible.\\nYou're right; I was just kind of thinking aloud.\"\n",

In this way, their way of life will be received as being not only harmless, but perfectly normal. As generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy, they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality. In this way, it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being, similar to a religion, race,  or nationality. Lestrade'\n",

I have read the policy, and think I understand it, and I disagree with him.  The word \"\"Sacramento\"\" was not linked anywhere else in this article before I made the link, and I think that my link provided good context for a reader who did not know Walnut Creek but thought that maybe they knew Sacramento.
